Day 1 – Environment Setup & Team Alignment

Ensure all members can run JAX successfully (preferably in Google Colab).

Test a minimal JAX script and verify understanding of JIT compilation.

Set up shared communication channels (GitHub repo, chat group, task board).

 Day 2 – Game State Design & Functional Thinking


day2

Define the minimal variables describing the game (e.g., position, velocity, score).

Introduce “pure functions” — no side effects or mutable global states.

Outline the environment update flow (state → new state).


Deliverable 
Written description of the game state and update process.

Day 3 – Core Mechanics & Rules

Design main behavior logic (movement, boundaries, simple reflection).

Ensure deterministic output (same input → same output).

Test logic correctness and reproducibility.

Deliverable 
Documented game loop logic and validation results.

 Day 4 – Visualization & Output Representation

Implement a simple way to visualize the game state (text or basic graphics).

Keep visualization separate from core logic.

Verify that every member can reproduce identical results.

Deliverable 
Demonstrable visualization of game dynamics.
 Day 5 – Integration & Documentation

English:

Combine all parts into a coherent prototype.

Write concise documentation explaining environment, logic, and rendering.

Review readability and correctness.


Deliverable 
Final working prototype with documentation, ready for submission.


 Day 6 – Final Review & GitHub Submission


Upload the finalized prototype and documentation to the shared GitHub repository.

Test on a clean environment to ensure reproducibility.

Prepare a brief summary paragraph describing the project’s purpose and results.


Deliverable / 成果：
Public GitHub repository containing the working prototype and documentation.
